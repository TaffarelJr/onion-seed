# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of this project is supported with security updates. I highly recommend keeping up-to-date.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I especially appreciate any information on how to improve the security of this code. Most of it should be pretty benign scaffolding; but the absolute last thing I want to do is open up someone else's software to hackers. Please report any security vulnerabilities by submitting an issue or pull request, and I'll reply as soon as I can.
