# Contributing to OnionSeed

First of all, thanks so much for your interest! While this is a personal project, I'd love to grow it into something larger. Any contributions are very much appreciated!

## The Rules

I need to set some guidelines for contributing to this project, but let's keep it short and sweet:

- Use your best judgement
- Do good instead of evil
- Don't be a jerk

That should just about cover it, right? Please review the official [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing for more info. We're all in this together!

## How to contribute

This is a GitHub project. Feel free to make use of the new [Discussions](https://github.com/TaffarelJr/onion-seed/discussions) area for conversations about best practices, ideas, help, requests, etc.

Also feel free to submit [Issues](https://github.com/TaffarelJr/onion-seed/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/TaffarelJr/onion-seed/pulls). It's pretty laid back around here.
