## Summary

This project contains common components, utilities, and scaffolding to enable applications to be created more quickly, following the tenets of SOLID, DDD, and Onion Architecture.

There is a great introductory article to the principles this project is intended to embody, archived [here](./docs/ExplicitArchitecture/Article.md).

View the [Wiki](https://github.com/TaffarelJr/onion-seed/wiki) for documentation about specific APIs included in this project.

## How to build the code

This is just a standard Visual Studio solution. [OnionSeed.sln](./OnionSeed.sln) is just at the root of the repo.

The unit test project compiles against each of the supported platforms; so you'll need to have the SDKs for each of them in order to compile fully. Most of them come with Visual Studio; and it should give you error messages explaining which ones you're missing, if any.
